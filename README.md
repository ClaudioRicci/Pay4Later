##Test Notes
DEVELOPER: Claudio Ricci

NOTES:
Each component has accompanying inline comments, explaining:

-> Key functionality
-> Things that I would have expanded on / were working on

Areas covered:

-> Successfully rendering list of partners in navigation
-> Successfully rendering of key values in main control panel
-> Key functionality for 'Count' and 'Total' and most of 'Subsidy' added
-> Deliberate use of 'Styled Components' and React Fragments in sections to demonstrate knowledge of latest React Features.
-> As an alternative to 'Styled Components', componentised CSS used. I have mixed the two simply to show different approaches; HOWEVER, IN PRODUCTION, I WOULD STICK TO COMPONENTISED CSS USING 'BEM' STYLING RULES

Issues that I would have addressed given more time:

-> Add tests - e.g. to calculate appropriate subsidy
-> Get routing working to allow user to navigate between Listed Companies and see result in main panel, rather than typing into Browser URL
-> Finalised 'Subsidy' functionality, to ensure appropriate 'Subsidy' per record rendered.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
